# mail-names-automation

So mail merging is where you take something like what

we have a list of names, for example, and we want to insert each of these names into a letter.

So instead of saying dear [name], you are invited to my birthday the Saturday, it should say dear

and then it would replace that with whatever is here.

Take a look at this example file.

You can see that it replaced the name placeholder with the first name in the invited_names.txt

file.

Your objective is to write some python code to automate the process.

So what you're going to end up with is a bunch of letters, one for each of the names inside the invited_

names.txt and the letters are going to be named like this: letter_for_ and

then the name of the person.

And they're going to be saved in a txt format, which you can open either in Google Docs or in Microsoft

Word.

And it's basically ready for printing.

So I've made it a little bit harder for you by adding in a whole bunch of folders.

And each of these files are nested inside a bunch of folders.

So, for example, starting letter is inside letters, which is inside input.

And then the letters that you're going to generate are going to need to go into this folder called Ready

ToSend, which is inside output
